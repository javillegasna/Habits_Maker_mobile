# Habits Maker Mobile App

Flutter project base on book atomic habits.

## Database design
The database has been designed following the advice given by jeames clear.
Based on the fact that habits are the most basic part of human behavior from which flows of behavior are created, which we call routines.
the set of routines shapes our personal identity, as well as the environments that surround us.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> we have used only those concepts that were considered relevant, since the book covers too many aspects.
